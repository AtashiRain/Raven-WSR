          <em>
          Storm Front: A Honsou Story.
          There are some things in life that give us such a sense of excitement that it feels more like trepidation. The adrenaline rush so strong that we feel nauseous.
          It was this feeling that Honsou felt as he addressed Tempest Squadron in the pristine light of the briefing room.
          "I expect better than your best" Honsou's tone was sharp as a Nexu's tooth. "We have been sent *REDACTED* to reinforce *REDACTED*. It is our role to ensure *REDACTED*"
          This set of turns made by the COMs of the TC Fleet were clearly meant to be big final pushes for glory in the third Imperial Storm tactical simulation and combat exercise.
          Honsou saluted his Squadron, "Let's make such an impact in the simulators that *REDACTED* feel it in their bunks for weeks to come!"
          Turning on his heels, Honsou led his squadron to the simulator deck. His hands still shaking with barely contained adrenaline, yearning for the fight to come.
          He only wished that it was *REDACTED* that they were going to be competing against.


          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          This week will see Tempest entering the fray in Imperial Storm III. Details are *REDACTED* due to prying eyes!

        <p>
          The Challenge Championship League continues and saw Snax Attax defeat the Temptations and 'TIE' with Fire Foul.
