          <em>
          Tempestuous Times: A Honsou Story.
          Sometimes in life we take a step back and think, how did I get here? Why am I here? What choices did I make?
          Or were these choices simply an illusion of free will and the path was ordained for me by some higher power?
          Staring out into the infinite black speckled with the distant twinkling lights of a billion suns, 
          newly appointed CMDR Honsou pondered these very questions. His new office, a generous living and working space
          separated by a half durasteel, half transparasteel dividing wall and remote shutters should he care for additional privacy.
          It was a stark contrast to the quarters he had shared with Flight III. Still at least he didn't have to listen to Coldsnacks snoring anymore.
          This had been the quarters of his CMDR Silwar, not two rotations ago. Silwar was now the COM of the ISD-II Challenge.
          Honsou had been pegged for a move to the Hammer to rebuild Delta Squadron but there had been unforeseen delays.
          He absently rubbed his left eye with his left index finger, the pain of the recent ocular injury still left ghosts of it’s discomfort.
          Then there were rumours about Honsou becoming a CMDR aboard the Challenge, Honsou had not dreamed it would be Tempest. Yet here he was.
          Honsou picked up his datapad and looked over the recent transmissions. VA Silwar and the others were doing a grand job of securing assets for the Challenge in Imperial Storm.
          Honsou tossed the datapad back onto the desk and balled his fists. “Rho” he growled… All that mattered was that he got his shot at Rho Squadron.
          Before his temper was able to flare completely, there was a chime at the intercom and his XO’s pleasant and soothing voice came through
          “Sir, the new pilot from IWATS has arrived.” Her voice as chipper and excitable as always. “Excellent,” Honsou allowed himself a wry smile, “send him in.”
          SL Gisornator stood to attention, until the doors closed, the XO heading back down the hallway beyond.
          “My Friend” Honsou smiled, sincerely this time. “It is good to see you, are you ready?”
          “Always!” Gisornator said, his attention stance switching to at ease, and he returned a knowing smile.
          Honsou rounded his desk and sat down reaching for the bottle Silwar had left him and two glasses. “Take a seat, we have much to discuss.
          These are tempestuous times and if you’re half as good as you used to be, they won’t know what hit them!”

          </em>

        <p>
          ReMob awards are still making their way through the fleet. I'm happy
          to say that out of twelve squadron members, we earned 24 medals -
          each member of Tempest earning the fleet's first Meritorious Unit
          Awards as well as an IS-GW each. The tailors are already working on
          updating our uniforms. Enjoy your well-earned bonus pay.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tempest King of the Mountain has been concluded! 
          With CM Wreckage emerging as the victor. VA Silwar taking 2nd place and CM Honsou taking 3rd.
          Whilst VA Silwar moved on to become COM of the ISDII Challenge and CM Honsou stepped up to CMDR of Tempest, in the wake of the final rounds.
          CM Wreckage decided to take the spoils and depart for Sin Squadron aboard the ISDII Warrior Where I am sure he will make a fine CMDR.

      <Closing>
        Well, I have been in command for 12 days at the point of writing this.
        Tempest is still the best Squadron in the entire TC Fleet and
        I haven't set the Challenge ablaze. I'd say we are off on the right foot!
        Great work everybody. We are the storm!
